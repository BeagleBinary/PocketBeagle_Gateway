Linux Quick Start Guide
***********************

This section serves as a road map for users developing applications and
products using a TI SimpleLink wireless MCU platform using |TIMAC|. Whether a
seasoned developer or just getting started, TI has created a variety of
resources to simplify development. These resources will enhance your experience
with the |TIMAC| from the out-of-the-box demo to production.

:numref:`fig-suggested-workflow` shows the suggested work-flow for getting
started with |TIMAC| development environment.

    Suggested Workflow

.. _get-started-learn:

Learn
=====

Resources contained in the Learn track of :numref:`fig-suggested-workflow` are
intended for users who are new to |TIMAC|. These modules demonstrate
how to quickly get started with |TIMAC|.

-  **SimpleLink Academy** |SLA|

.. _get-started-develop:

Develop
=======

The develop track of :numref:`fig-suggested-workflow` is intended for
programmers who are ready to start developing an end product using |TIMAC|.
To begin:

#.  **Download the TI 15.4-Stack Linux SDK** `TI 15.4-Stack Linux SDK
    <http://www.ti.com/tool/ti-15.4-stack-gateway-linux-sdk>`_ contains the
    code necessary to create a complete IEEE 802.15.4g compliant Linux
    application. These examples should be considered as starting points for end
    product designs. To install |TIMAC|, run the installer downloaded above.
    See :ref:`chap-development-environment` for help installing the TI
    15.4-Stack Linux SDK.


#.  **Get Familiar with the Users Guide** The Users Guide is meant to be used
    alongside the |TIMAC| when developing an end product. It contains
    documentation on the stack architecture, APIs, and suggestions for
    developing applications. To jump to the Table of Contents, click here:
    :ref:`ldg-overview`

#.  **Select an Example Project** The Linux Collector Example Application
    interfaces with a SimpleLink™ /CC26x2 device running the |TIMAC| CoProcessor
    firmware through UART. The Linux Collector Example Application provides the
    same functionality as the Embedded Collector Application with the addition
    of providing a socket server interface to the Linux Gateway Application.
    The Linux Gateway Application is implemented within the Node.js® framework
    and connects as a client to the socket server created by the Linux
    Collector Example Application and establishes a local web server to which
    the user can connect through a web browser (in the local network) to
    monitor and control the network devices. The Collector and Gateway
    Applications are a great starting point for creating Internet of Things
    (IoT) applications with TI 15.4-Stack. For more details on these and all
    other included projects, see
    :ref:`chap-linux-example-applications`.


#.  **Troubleshooting Help** While developing your custom application, you may
    run into issues that require the use of a debugger.
    The :ref:`sec-troubleshooting` chapter provides help with understanding
    common problems.
    If you are still having problems after reading through the Troubleshooting
    chapter, see the :ref:`get-started-support` track for more options.

.. _get-started-enhance:

Enhance
=======

The enhance track of :numref:`fig-suggested-workflow` is intended to take your
product to the next level by leveraging TI’s web-based collateral. Additional
resources found in these pages include application-specific source code
examples and complete sub-system designs.

**TI Designs™**

software examples, using |TIMAC|.

.. _get-started-support:

Support
=======

The support track of :numref:`fig-suggested-workflow` is intended to provide
you additional help and resources that aren't contained in the previous tracks.

- **E2E Forums** `www.e2e.ti.com <https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless-connectivity/>`_

A support community providing answers to questions relating to |TIMAC|. You can
browse questions from other developers or ask your own questions if you run
into issues developing with the |TIMAC|.
