SDK Description
===============

.. note::

    #.  The default SDK Installation directory is:
        ${HOME}/ti/simplelink/ti15.4stack-2.xx.xx.xx. References to the
        ${SDK\_ROOT} in this document refer to this directory location.
    #.  The numbering convention is: Major, Minor, Patch, BuildID
        The Linux Build ID is independent of the Embedded SDK Build ID and can
        be a different number.

:numref:`fig-oob-dir` shows the Linux SDK is divided into several directories.
